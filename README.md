# My Git Introduction
## collecting scripts from recent chapters
So far I have just a simple hello world script and a sample if-then-else script from the shell scripting assignment. These are to get used to the process of committing locally and to a remote repository.
## What's next?
I should clone the repository to another computer or directory to practice pulls and pushes to the remote.
The End
